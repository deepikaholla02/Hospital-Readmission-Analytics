## 📌 **Project Overview**

Hospital readmissions are a critical indicator of healthcare quality, operational efficiency, and patient outcomes. High readmission rates not only increase costs but also signal potential gaps in clinical care, discharge planning, or post-treatment follow-up.

This project delivers a production-style, end-to-end healthcare analytics solution that transforms raw hospital admission data into actionable clinical and operational insights through:

  - Robust data cleaning and feature engineering

  - Relational database integration (MySQL)

  - Advanced SQL analytics

  - Interactive Power BI dashboards

  - Streamlit-ready ML prediction pipeline

The solution is designed to closely resemble real-world healthcare analytics workflows used in hospitals, insurance providers, and health tech companies.# Hospital-Readmission-Analytics.

## 🎯 **Business Objectives**

  - Analyze readmission patterns across age groups, diagnoses, and medical specialties

  - Identify high-risk patient segments prone to readmission

  - Evaluate length of stay, medication load, and emergency visits as risk factors

  - Enable data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators and clinicians

  - Lay groundwork for predictive readmission modeling
